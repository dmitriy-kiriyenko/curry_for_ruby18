# Curry
[![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/dmitriy-kiriyenko/curry_for_ruby18.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dmitriy-kiriyenko/curry_for_ruby18)

In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique
of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments (or an n-tuple
of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of
functions each with a single argument (partial application).

# For Ruby
Ruby 1.9.x has currying already. For 1.8.7 use this gem. It
adds Proc#curry that does just its stuff. Warning - it does not affect arity.
